            "- STROBES like the ACR C-Strobe can save precious time when activated. \n",
            "- POWERFLARE SAFETY LIGHT and strobes like this (in red case, bottom right) emit SOS or flashing lights to alert rescue personnel.\n",
            "- SIGNAL MIRRORS can alert rescue personnel in bright daylight, cost practically nothing and are recommended by the USCG.\n",
            "- WHISTLES are great at attracting rescue personnel when visibility is poor.\n",
            "- ROPE can keep the crew together should a lifeboat not be available.\n",
            "- A GERBER HINDERER serrated blunt-point knife is less likely to puncture a life raft and will make quick work of slicing ropes or bandages.\n",
            "- FIRST AID KITS should include a ready supply of essential medications you may need on a frequent basis.\n",
            "- DRINKING WATER should be accompanied by a measuring device to carefully apportion it to maintain life and morale.\n",
            "- SUNSCREEN and Dramamine can ease discomfort adrift.\n",
            "- CASH and a copy of your passport in a sandwich bag can facilitate a return to America from foreign waters.\n",
